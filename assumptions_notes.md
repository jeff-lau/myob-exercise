Assumptions:


// Assume no need to take into account public holidays.
// Assume no internationalisations, ignoring any timezone and localization issues.
// We have to handle partial months.
// Assume current year when determining number of Days in month (this impacts leap year)


Notes:
// The project scaffolding is simply pulled from a public git repo - https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
// For date handling in javascript I am simply pulling angular-moment from git (momentjs)
